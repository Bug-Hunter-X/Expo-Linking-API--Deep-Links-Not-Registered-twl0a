This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The app may not register the URL scheme correctly, resulting in the deep link not being opened. This often manifests as the deep link simply not working, or the app failing to launch when the link is tapped.  Here's an example demonstrating incorrect registration:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
  console.log('Deep link received:', event.url);
  // Handle the URL here
});

Linking.makeUrl('myapp://some-path'); //Incorrect usage
```
